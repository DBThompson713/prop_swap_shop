<h1><strong>PropSwap Shop</strong></h1>

<p>Completed for Coderacademy - October 2019</p>

<h3><strong>Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>In the Australian market, there is not currently a dedicated online  marketplace for individuals to buy and sell plants, props and plant cuttings.</p>
<p>If a person wants to sell or buy plants online, barring setting up an online store, the only options are gumtree or ebay. Neither of which are set up to handle the specific intricacies of shipping and handling plants. Furthermore, with gumtree, you never know who you are dealing with, the quality of the product, and lastly there is no easy recourse for correction in the event that something goes wrong</p>
<p>Propswap Shop will fill the gap which currently exists in the niche market of plant, prop and cutting - user to user sales.</p>
<p>The idea is to simplify the purchasing and selling of plants while simultaneously ensuring the safety of the plants themselves, as well as the protection of the environment and enforcement biosecurity laws.</p>


<!-- POTENTIAL ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS -->

<br/>
<h5>Potential issues - Possible solutions</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Australia has strict bio-protection laws - even between states</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Showing buyers only the plants which are currently for sale in their state will eliminate the risk of unintentionally breaking bio-protection laws.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Plants are not able to survive long trips in boxes</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>By limiting the buyers to plants located in their state, it should minimise the travel time between buyer and seller
</li>
<li>Only allowing express shipping will help ensure that plants arrive alive.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li><strong>Shipping costs and methods should be standardised</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>As a stretch goal, incorporating an Auspost API to calculate the shipping for each sale as well as forcing only express shipping will ensure that costs and methods are standardised. It will also ensure that sellers are not "ripping off" buyers through exorbitant shipping costs.</li>
</ul>
